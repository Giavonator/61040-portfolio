# Assignment 1
## 1. Domains
#### 1.1 Brainstorm Domains
- MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team: Building a solar vehicle with friends.
- MIT Men's Soccer Club: Kick a ball around, but competitively!
- La Maison Française: My cultural house within New House.
- Competitive Programming: LeetCode, but competitively (CodeForces)!
- Cooking/Eating: Who doesn't love food!
- Family: Won't see for several months, but miss them lots!
- Classes/Schedule: Keeping your calendar/timeline in check is important!
- Sleep: Speaking of which, maybe I need a nap.
- Working out: Personally, I do a MWF PPL split.
- Meditation: Although not fully developed, something I've been trying recently.

#### 1.2 Most Promising Domains
- La Maison Française (LMF): Located on the West half of New House 4th floor, around 30 students live together with a shared love for France. This is where I've called home for all of my undergrad and where my deepest friendships have been created over the semesters. In my heart considered as my home away from home.
- MIT Solar Electrive Vehicle Team: I spend around 10 hours every work dedicated to the design and development of our solar car Solstice. The 25-26 school year we must get done a lot of the manifacturing, and hopefully should be all ready to compete next summer!
- MIT Men's Soccer Club: If there was one thing I've loved for longer than software, it 100% would be soccer. Being Uruguayan we don't grow up with religion, but rather praying to our favorite national team players to be our rivals Argentina and Brazil.

## 2. Problems

#### 2.1 Brainstorm Problems

##### 2.1.1 MIT Men's Football Club (MFC):

1. Attendance: Practice/game attendance is tracked through clunky spreadsheet.

2. Performance: Playing time is directly related to our performance, but with the captain being a player biases come through and playing time is affected.

3. Tardiness: Players are constantly late, with no reprocussions.

##### 2.1.2 La Maison Française (LMF):

1. Requesting Subs: Our house is built around a cooking system, but the current process for asking for a cooking sub is not great.

2. Food Management: We need to feed 30+ people every day for dinner, food management is such an issue we have two people dedicated to it.

3. Nettoyage Points: We have a chore system at our house, but managed through slack makes it clunky and lacks transparency.


##### 2.1.3 MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team (SEVT):

1. Organization: Currently no system is in place tracking who is working on what.

2. Attendance: Schedules are erradict, not ever really sure who will be in lab or when.

3. Lack of social outings: All of last year there were only 1-2 social outings, a number that should be significantly greater!


#### 2.2 Great Filtering


##### 2.2.1 Rejected

1. *SEVT Social Outings*:
    - Indifference: If people cared enough there would have been more outings.
    - Lack of Critical Mass: Lack of interest, not enough users.

2. *SEVT Attendance*:
    - Friction: If hectic MIT schedules prevent members to show up consistently at same times, where would they get the extra time for this?

3. *LMF Nettoyage Points*:
    - Antibodies: Keeping track of chores generally has lots of problems associated.
    - Insufficient Differentiation: Difficult to make something that spreadsheets can't already do.

4. *SEVT Organization*:
    - Friction: Hectic schedules prevent spreadsheets to be maintained, how what that be any different here?
    - Insufficient Differentiation: Difficult to make something that spreadsheets can't already do.

5. *MFC Performance*:
    - Ignoring Stakeholders: Not sure not as well performing players want to see themselves last compared to other players.
    - Unexpected Consequences: Introducing this could cause a lot of tension and problems within the team.

6. *MFC Tardiness*:
    - Unexpected Consequences: What if people that would've showed up late just don't show up anymore to avoid being late?
    - Indifference: Is people showing up late really that big of a problem?
